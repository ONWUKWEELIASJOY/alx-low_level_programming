C - More pointers, arrays and strings. A pointer is a variable which holds the address of other variable of the specified data type(like int,float,char). In programming we basically use pointers
to store the other variable's address. A pointer variable is declared with a '*' before it. int *a . An array is a collection of elements
of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by using an index to a unique identifier. Five
values of type int can be declared as an array without having to declare five different variables (each with its own identifier). Differences(An array is a set of objects of the same type. Whereas a pointer
is a variable that contains the address of another variable. The number of variables that an array may hold is determined by its size. But a pointer variable can only store the address of one variable).
